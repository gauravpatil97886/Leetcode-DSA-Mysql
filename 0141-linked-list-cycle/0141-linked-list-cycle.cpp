        *  If a linked list has a cycle, there must be a node which
        *  two different nodes point to. Taking an example:
        *    head -> ... -> a -> b -> ... -> c -> b -> ...
        *  Let's think about the way we reverse a linked list. The first time
        *  that we encounter b, we make it pointing back to a, and move to
        *  the next node (into the cycle). Now, we've processed c and move to
        *  b again, and b is pointing to a. That is, after we process b twice,
        *  we'll process every node before b, in the original list, and
        *  eventually back to head.
        *  Hence, if a linked list has a cycle, and if we reverse it, we'll
        *  have two same head.
